In case `T` is `Send`, stub `ThreadChecker` is used and does nothing.    This implementation is used by default. Compile fails if `T: !Send`. 2. In case `T` is `!Send`, `ThreadChecker` panics when `T` is accessed by another thread.    This implementation is used when `#[pyclass(unsendable)]` is given.    Panicking makes it safe to expose `T: !Send` to the Python interpreter, where all objects    can be accessed by multiple threads by `threading` module."]]});
